Text-Formatter
==============

To run:

gcc formatter.c



./a.out ipsum.txt


Formats a text so that it fits nicely into a given number of columns.

The text formatter right-justifies an input text file so the right margins are
aligned in a straight line. The last line is not right justified. 
Also, paragraphs are not merged together.

The first line of the input file is the number of columns (characters) in which
to print the text file.
